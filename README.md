<b>What isn't working:</b><br>
1) Desktop header drop down function is not working, not complete
2) Featured products: not complete
3)Cannot load more than two rows for popular items. Did not include json functionality for that
4)Some minor styling bugs in Safari, but besides that, Safari, Edge, Chrome & Firefox work
