<b>What's working, what isn't:</b><br>
1) Mobile Navigation drop down menu will only work if you refresh the page below 1280px. If you refresh page on 1280px, then resize below 1280px the drow down menu function will not work. Same goes for footer drop down.
2) Product slider is only working on mobile as of yet, however all product styles are finished
3) Desktop header drop down function is not working, not complete
4) Featured products: not complete
4) Everything else should work as intended. Hamburger, sliders and all animations are done by CSS.
